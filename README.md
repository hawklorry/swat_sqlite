# swat_sqlite
This repo has two main branches: SWAT and SWAT_SQLITE. The master brach is not used.

The SWAT branch tracks the official SWAT codes. It starts from Rev627 and then jumps to Rev664. 

The SWAT_SQLIT branch tracks the sqlite version of SWAT codes. It also starts from Rev627 and then jumps to Rev664.

Tags has been created for each revision. 

Once a new version of SWAT is available, first update the SWAT branch and then merge the changes to SWAT_SQLITE branch.
